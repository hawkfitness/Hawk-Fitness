        1. Place your toes and the balls of your feet on the foot support. Place the shoulder pads against your shoulders and stand upright with your feet hip-width. This is your starting position.<br>
        2. Lower yourself down until you feel a slight stretch in your calves by bending your ankles in a controlled movement. Avoid letting your heels drop too quickly or bounce at the bottom.<br>
        3. Push yourself up by extending your ankles to lift your heels as high as possible.

        1. Place a barbell on your shoulders, and stand with your toes and the ball of your feet on a step, like a weight plate or something similar. Stand upright in the starting position, preferably with your back against a wall, so the weight plates on the bar touch the wall.<br>
        2. Lower yourself down by bending your ankles in a controlled movement.<br>
        3. Push yourself up using your calf strength by extending your ankles.

        1. Stand on the edge of a raised platform in front of something sturdy, like a railing or bench, with your heels hanging off the edge.<br>
        2. Lean forward and support your upper body with your arms, bending at the hips until your torso is parallel to the ground.<br>
        3. Lower your heels as far as they can go, feeling a stretch in your calf muscles.<br>
        4. Push through the balls of your feet to lift your heels as high as possible, squeezing your calves at the top.
