        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outward. The barbell should be over the middle of your feet, close to your shins.<br>
        2. Bend at the hips and knees to reach the bar. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. You can use an overhand grip (both palms facing you) or a mixed grip (one palm facing you and the other facing away).<br>
        3. Keep your back straight and chest up. Engage your core and ensure your shoulders are slightly in front of the bar. Your hips should be higher than your knees but lower than your shoulders.<br>
        4. Pull the bar close to your body, with a straight back, until you are standing straight. Keep the bar close to your body, and your arms straight throughout the lift. The bar should travel in a straight line vertically.<br>
        5. Reverse the motion by hinging at the hips and bending the knees. Lower the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner, maintaining a straight back.<br>
        6. Reset your position if necessary.

        1. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.<br>
        2. Stand with your feet slightly wider than feet hip-width apart, bend your knees slightly, and hinge forward at your hips, maintaining a straight line from your head to your hips.<br>
        3. Brace your core and keep your back straight. Pull the barbell towards your lower chest or upper abdomen, keeping your elbows close to your body. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.<br>
        4. Lower the barbell back to the starting position in a controlled manner.<br>
        5. Breathe out as you lift, in as you lower, like blowing out candles on a birthday cake, then inhaling the sweet smell of victory.

        <br>
        1. Place a dumbbell on the floor beside a bench or some other sturdy object. Stand facing the bench and place your left hand and the knee of your left leg on top of it.<br>
        2. Grip the dumbbell with your right hand. Hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back flat and your torso roughly parallel to the floor. <br>
        3. Engage your core muscles and right leg to stabilize your body throughout the movement. <br>
        4. While maintaining the position of your upper body and keeping your elbow close to your side, inhale and pull the dumbbell up towards your torso by retracting your shoulder blade. Focus on squeezing your back muscles as you lift.<br>
        5. Continue pulling the dumbbell until it reaches the side of your torso. Row it closer to your hips to target your lower lats. Squeeze your lats at the top of the movement, ensuring a strong contraction in your back muscles.<br>
        6.Lower the dumbbell back to the starting point while exhaling, maintaining control throughout the descent.

        3. Return with control to the starting position, by letting your arms move forward again.
