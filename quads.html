    <div class="txt">
        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your arms extended down by your sides, palms facing inwards.<br>
        2. Inhale and brace your core muscles to stabilize your spine and pelvis during the movement.<br>
        3. Squat down as deep as you comfortably can. Keep your knees tracking over your toes and maintain a straight back throughout the movement.<br>
        4. When your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly lower, reverse the movement and return to a standing position, exhaling on the way up.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Adjust the machine so that you only need to extend your legs slightly to be able to release the weights. The most important thing is to ensure the safety pins can catch the weight if you fail a rep.<br>
        2. Place your feet on the platform, about shoulder-width apart.<br>
        3. Inhale and lower the weight by bending your legs.<br>
        4. Lower the weight as deep as possible without rounding your back and while keeping your glutes on the seat.<br>
        5. Press the weight back up again as you exhale.

        1. Adjust the leg extension machine so the pad is just above your feet, with a ∼90-degree angle between your upper and lower legs.<br>
        2. Sit on the seat and place your ankles behind the pad, ensuring that they align with the pivot point of the machine.<br>
        3. Sit on the seat and place your ankles behind the pad, ensuring that they align with the pivot point of the machine.<br>
        4. Engage your core and maintain an upright posture.<br>
        5. Extend your legs, raising the weighted bars in a controlled manner. Focus on the quadriceps muscles as you move.<br>
        6. Ensure that the motion is smooth and that you’re not using momentum or jerking the weight up.<br>
        7. Extend your legs fully, hold this position for a moment, and squeeze your quads.<br>
        8. Lower the weight back to the starting position with full control.
