        1. Lie face down on the leg curl machine. Slip the backs of your ankles under the pad and keep your hips down. Draw the belly button inwards to avoid movement compensations.<br>
        2. Curl the weight towards your glutes.<br>
        3. Lower slowly to maximize time under tension during the eccentric portion. Rinse and repeat.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Find a 25-pound bumper plate or low platform to elevate the toes and bring the feet close together.<br>
        2. As you hinge, reach the dumbbells out so they’re tracking over the toes instead of keeping them close to the body.<br>
        3. Control the eccentric tempo to feel the stretch properly.<br>
        4. Pause for a second in the bottom position, then hinge back up.

        1. Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart. Grip the barbell with an overhand grip in front of the thighs. Keep your chest up and shoulders down.<br>

        1. Attach a rope to the cable set on its lowest setting. Turn around and face away from the machines with the rope attachment between your legs. Face your palms toward each other..<br>
        2. Take a few steps away from the machine until you feel the tension in the cable.<br>
        3. Set your feet hip-width apart. Hinge down while keeping a neutral spine.<br>
        4. Squeeze your glutes to reverse the movement. Reset and repeat.

        1. Adjust the machine so that you are correctly positioned. Your knees should be in line with the machine’s joint.<br>
        2. Push the weight down by bending your knees as far as possible.<br>
        3. Slowly let the weight back again.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Fix your feet under something to hold them in place or have a training partner hold them down, and place a soft pad under your knees.<br>
        2. With a straight hip, slowly lower yourself down toward the ground. Be prepared to catch yourself with your hands if the exercise gets too heavy.<br>
        3. When you touch the ground, use your hands to get back into the starting position (eccentric-only curls), or contract your hamstrings hard to lift yourself up using only hamstring strength.
