        <br>
        1. Lie on your back with your hands in front of your chest and your knees bent to about 90 degrees.<br>
        2. Lift your shoulder blades off the floor by contracting your abs and bending forward.<br>
        3. Bend as far forward as possible while keeping your low back in contact with the floor, and then return to the starting position.<br>
        4. Repeat the movement for your desired number of repetitions.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Attach a rope handle to the high pulley of the cable machine. Kneel down on the floor or a mat, about a foot or two from the machine, facing the pulley.<br>
        2. Bend your upper body forward by contracting your abs, bringing your elbows toward your knees. Hold the ropes on either side of your head throughout the movement.<br>
        3. Keep your hips stationary and avoid bending at the hips. The movement should solely come from your waist and abdominals crunching down.<br>
        4. Once you’re in the fully crunched position, squeeze your abs to maximize the contraction.<br>
        5. Return to the starting position by extending your waist. Again, ensure the movement is controlled, resisting the weight on the way back up.

        <br>
        1. Lie on your back like a bug that’s been flipped over, with your arms straight up towards the ceiling and your legs stacked over your hips, with the knees bent in a 90-degree angle.<br>
        2. Engage your core, and make sure that the lower back has contact with the surface.<br>
        3. With control, straighten out the right leg and lower it towards the floor at the same time as you lower the left arm over your head as far as you can. Keep the lower back in contact with the floor the entire time.<br>
        4. Reverse the movement, and repeat for the other side.
