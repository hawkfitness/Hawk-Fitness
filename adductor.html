        1. Start by sitting on the machine with the pads positioned between your legs as wide as is comfortable, and select your desired resistance.<br>
        2. In a controlled manner, squeeze your thighs together just until the pads touch, feeling the muscles contract.<br>
        3. Slowly reverse the movement, returning your thighs to the starting position.<br>
        4. Complete one set and then switch sides.

        1. Set your feet a bit wider than shoulder width, turning your toes slightly outward.<br>
        2. Shift your weight back and slowly lower your hips until your thighs are parallel to the floor.<br>
        3. In a controlled motion, return to the starting position by pushing through the floor, feeling the muscles of your glutes and legs, including your adductors, contract.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Start by wrapping a resistance band around a solid anchor such as a power rack or another piece of equipment that is attached to the floor.<br>
        2. Standing with either side of your body facing the anchor point, wrap the band around your inner (working) foot.<br>
        3. Adjust the tension of the resistance band by standing farther away from the anchor point or wrapping the band more tightly.<br>
        4. Allow the band to pull your leg to the side while resisting the movement.<br>
        5. To start the exercise, stand tall and bring your banded leg toward the center of your body, feeling a good contraction in your adductors.<br>
        6. lowly release your leg back to the side, with control.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart.<br>
        2. Step out with your right leg and begin sending your hips back as you bend your right knee. You can reach your arms forward for counterbalance if you like. During the descent, your knee should not move more than about 2 inches beyond your toes, and you should keep your knee aligned between your second and third toe. The toe of the foot that steps out may turn outward slightly.<br>
        3. Push off with your right leg to return to a standing position.<br>
        4. Repeat on your left leg to complete 1 rep.
