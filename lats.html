        2. Inhale and perform a hip hinge, tipping over and allowing the bar to glide down until it hangs just below your kneecap.<br>
        3. From here, brace your core; your torso should be parallel-ish to the floor.<br>
        4. Hold your air and row the barbell up toward your lower abdomen.<br><br>

        2. Sit back and lie down on the bench. Hold the insides of one end of the dumbbell/barbell in your palms with your arms extended directly upward, elbows straight. <br>
        3. From here, gradually lower the dumbbell back behind your head without bending your elbows.<br>
        4. Once your arms are parallel to your torso (if your shoulder mobility permits), reverse the motion and contract your lats to bring the dumbbell/barbell back to the starting position.<br><br>

        2. Firmly “spike” your back foot into the floor behind you or out to the side. Brace your core.<br>
        3. Reach down with your working arm and grab the dumbbell, then take a deep belly breath.<br>
        4. Row the dumbbell up until your upper arm is parallel with your torso, then lower it slowly back down without letting it touch the floor again.
