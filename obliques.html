        <br>
        1. Start on all fours with your hands in line with your shoulders and knees in line with your hips.<br>
        2. Inhale, brace your core, and reach your right arm and left leg straight out so they’re both parallel to the ground.<br>
        3. Ensure that your lower back stays stable and your hips stay square to the ground.<br>
        4. Exhale and return to start. Repeat with the left arm and right leg.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Lie on the ground on your back, bringing your legs to tabletop position.<br>
        2. Bend your elbows and place your hands behind your head.<br>
        3. Using your core, lift your head, neck, and shoulders off the ground, and bring your right elbow to your left knee, straightening your right leg.<br>
        4. Release slightly and twist to the other side, bending your right leg, straightening your left leg, and bringing your left elbow to your right knee.

    </div>
    <div class="txt">
        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Start in a high plank position, but with your glutes slightly higher than they would be in that position. Wrists are under shoulders and your neck is neutral.<br>
        2. Drive your left knee forward toward your right elbow, keeping the rest of your body stationary.<br>
        3. Return to start, then repeat with the right leg.

        <h1>Russian Twist</h1>

    <div class="txt">
        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Sit down on the floor or on a mat, keeping your feet on the ground. Your heels should stay on the floor, but your toes can be off the ground. Squeeze your glutes for stability.br>
        2. Lean back, forming a right angle from your torso relative to your thigh.<br>
        3. Raise your arms out in front of you. Look up at your hands (and the weight, once you progress to working with a load)—you'll keep your gaze trained there throughout the movement.<br>
        4. Rotate your torso from one side to the other, pausing for a beat in the middle position between each rep. Move slowly, and keep your eyes on the weight. Keep the load out as far as possible to keep the lever long to challenge your abs. Only work within you range of motion; once your hips and knees begin to shift, you've gone too far.

        <b>How to do it:</b>
        <br>
        1. Assume a standard pushup position.<br>
        2. As you lower your body toward the floor, lift your right foot off of the floor, swing your leg out sideways and try to touch your knee to your elbow.<br>
        3. Reverse the movement as you push your body back to the starting position.
